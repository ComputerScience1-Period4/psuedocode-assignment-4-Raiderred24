How to play Golf:
Your goal is to score the lowest possible score over 9 rounds
Avgerage run time 45 minutes-1 hour 15 minutes
Required people: 2-8
Start with 2 decks (jokers included) and shuffle them
Deal 6 cards to all people and flip the 2 center cards
Card values are: Aces=1, #'s=their value, Queens=10, Jacks=10, Kings=0, Jokers=-5
The person to the right of the dealer starts by either taking the card they can see or flipping 1 card over form the draw pile.
If they flip the card from the draw pile they cannot take the card that they could see.
If they choose to take the card they drew they can replace one of their cards or put it in the face up pile for the next person to use, if they choose.
If they take the face up card on top or draw a card they want, they can trade out one of their 6 cards, face up or down and are then forced to put the card they had on the face up pile.
1 round ends after any one person flips all 6 of their cards over.
If someone reveals all 6 of their cards 1 more round goes around so as to keep it fair
Points are then counted up and tallied over the 9 rounds by a scorekeeper.
Additional rules: If 2 of the same card are directly above and below each other they cancel and count as 0 (-10 if jokers)
If 4 of the cards are the same card in a square directly next to each other they equal -20 (-40 if jokers)
If 6 of the cards are the same card your entire hand counts as -50
If turning a face down card from your hand over you MUST put it on the face up deck and cannot keep it.
You win the game by having the least points at the end of 9 rounds.
